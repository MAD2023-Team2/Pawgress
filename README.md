# Pawgress
## Introduction
Pawgress is a productivity app that aims to help users stay motivated and on track with their tasks and goals. With Pawgress, users may create a personalized task list and earn in-app currency by completing each task. Pawgress's distinguishing feature is the virtual pet that users may adopt and care for with their earnings. The app's gamification approach to productivity makes staying focused on goals more entertaining and interesting for users, while also delivering a sense of connection with their virtual pet. Daily activities become more rewarding for users, concurrently aiding them in reaching their personal and professional goals.

## Stage 1 Features
### 1. Login [Zachary]
Create accounts and login to our app to save progress and tasks. There is an auto login function where users who previously created an account on their device will not have to input their login credentials to login, bringing them straight to their daily logins.

### 2. Pet Selection [Hannah]
Upon creating an account, users can select which animal they prefer as their companion and a random design of that particular animal will be generated and assigned to the user.

### 3. Daily Login [Chun Fai]
Users are encouraged to login daily to commit to their tasks and target time. Our app records how many days in a row where the user logins to the app and will reward them with currency (implementing in stage 2)

### 4. Navigation Bar [Zachary]
This grants easy access to our main functions. Users can navigate to the Home Page, Task List, Game and the Profile Page anytime within these few pages.

### 5. Home Page [Walter]
Shows a compact task list, users can mark them as complete from here, or go straight into the individual task details by tapping on one task.

### 6. Task List [Fionn]
Lists down all tasks that are in progress, showing the task's category and name. From the task list, users can choose to create, edit, view, delete or mark a task as complete. The targetted time to spend on each task can be set when creating or editing it. When users tap on one task card, further details of the task will be shown, along with a timer button.

### 7. Task Timer [Walter]
Choosing to start the timer button will bring the user to the game page where the timer will start running automatically. This timer will stop once the user exits the timer page or pauses the timer. The total time taken for each task will be saved for future analytics purpose.

### 8. Editing User credentials [Hannah]
Username and password can be changed in this page
